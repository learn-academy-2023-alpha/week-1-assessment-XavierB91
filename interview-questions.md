# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

<!-- Your answer: an conditional statement is basically  allows the programmer to give the computer an what if scenario in which it can conduct it's coding process. It allows us to set parameters for the computer to follow like a chain if certain inputs are used by the user.  -->

Researched answer: In programming language, code has to be able to make descisons and execute actions based on a users input.  Conditonal statements allow us to represent descion making by giving us a choice to be made and an outcome as an result.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a programming tool that allows for easy acess and sharing of software and code. Github is an online cloud that acts as a storage unit for developers around the world to access and work on code. It's open source I believe making it easy to transfer and work on code globally. 

Researched answer: Git is a version control program used to monitor alteration in source code as the software is being developed.  Git is software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, that allows for developers to to track changes within the code made by other developers and allows them to collborate together on code.  Git allows developers to modify and make changes to software. Github is the largest host of source code around the world and has been owned by tech giant Microsoft since 2018.  Github is cloud-based storage that allows for social collobaration on projects.Source (https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_intro.asp?remote=github)

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

<!-- Your answer: equaity  and relational operator return a boolean value.  Equaity operators determine if the vaule of one object is comparable with the vaule of another. concurrently, an relational operator looks at the relationship between two vaules and returns a boolean expression back. I.e. is 2 >0 ? true or false. -->
 Researched answer 

JavaScript Logical  Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and give back a boolean value: either true or false. Logical operators are used in decision making and loops. source (https://codehs.com/tutorial/ryan/booleans-and-logical-operators-in-javascript)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?  

Your answer:
<!-- An index is a placeholder for an the location of a vaule within a array. an value represents the information or element that is on display within the array. -->
Researched answer: Index is a collection of data that is ordered and listed by the index value of an element. Whereas an vaule is a chunk of information represented in javascript. Each chunk of information has a value that is determined by it's role within the code.  source (https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html#:~:text=In%20a%20JavaScript%20environment%2C%20those,must%20merely%20invoke%20its%20name.)

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

<!-- Your answer: an array is a collection of various data types , often numbers that display information to the developer. In contrast , strings are a specific type of data type that can be used within arrays and in other forms with a log. Array's and Strings are similar in that they are both used to represent data. Where they differ I believe is that arrays are collections of different data types, whereas strings represent letters in standard english formatting specfically.  -->

Researched answer:
Arrays and strings are both very different in how they can be implemented with in Javascript. Arrays can have data of any length, whereas strings are typically characters from the alphabet.  Strings are a sequence of characters that represent a singular line of data within object.  Addtionally,  unlike arrays, strings are immutable pieces of code, meaning that their value cannot be reassigned once they have been given one. Concurrently, an array can be changed based on the needs of it's primary user.  source ( http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-array-and-string/)

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person
Pair programming is a system of coding in which two or more developers work together to share the cognitative load and strain of coding with each other. Pair programming allows one developer to be the driver, who writes and implements the code. The other partner in the pair acts as a navigtor settting a path for the driver to follow, carefully reviewing the code as it's being inputed and offering the driver assitance as they enter the code.

Researched answer:

Paired programming is a colloborative programming technique used to divide the labor between two developers using four eyes and four hands. In paired programming driver writes the code and the navigator checks the code being written. The driver is tasked to focus on the specifics of coding and inputing into the terminal. Whereas, the navigator checks the work, code quality and provides the driver with guided direction. The two developers take turns coding, reviewing and checking on each other's work. Paired programming allows for fewer mistakes between the developers, helpful collaboration and knowledge sharing during the programming process. Ultimately, Pair programming is a process that involves alot of communication and dialog between both programmers.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
a function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is known as a higher order function. Basically a higher order function can use functions as data type.  Source:  https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html

2. Jest: Jest is a javascript test runner, Jest allows a developer to create, structure and run various code.  Jest allows you to test different units of code like functions.  source (https://www.valentinog.com/blog/jest/)

3. Objects: An object is like a storage unit for the data with different properties and types.  A object has properties associated with it similar to an value within a variable.  Objects in javascript allows the developer to store multiple collections of data. source (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)

4. Method: a method is a function that is stored as an object's property.  A method carries with it the defintion of the function. source (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp) 

5. Classes:
 Classes serves as a template for creating objects.  Classes contain data with the code  enable for the code to work on the data from within.  Classes are essentially a specialized function, a subprogram that can be called upon to the function.
